1. Open /app/config/site.php and edit the URL, site name, email, Analytics ID, and reCAPTCHA keys.

2. Import database.sql into your MySQL server. Usually, you can just do that with PHPMyAdmin (most of the Web hosting out there offer PHPMyAdmin).

3. Open /app/config/config.php and replace with your database information.

4. Visit your website by going to your URL e.g. http://your-own-kikornot.com


Enjoy!
