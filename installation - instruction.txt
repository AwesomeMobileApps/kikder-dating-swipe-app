1. Update the URL, site name, email and Analytics ID details by editing /app/config/site.php

2. Import database.sql into your MySQL server. Usually, you can just do that with PHPMyAdmin (most of web hostings offer PHPMyAdmin).

3. Open /app/config/config.php and replace with your database information.

4. Visit your website by going to your URL e.g. http://your-own-kikornot.com


Enjoy!
